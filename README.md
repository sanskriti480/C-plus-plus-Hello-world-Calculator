Experiment 1

Aim - Hello World & Calculator Program.
Apparatus: VS Code or Programiz online C++ compiler.

Theory - 
Program 1:
This program demonstrates the basic structure of a C++ program and the use of the cout statement to display output on the screen. This C++ program displays the message "Hello World" on the screen. It begins with
#include<iostream>, which is used to include the input-output stream library necessary for displaying output. The line using namespace std; allows the programmer to use standard functions like cout without the 
prefixing them with std::. The main() function is the entry point of the program, and the code inside it is executed when the program runs. The statement cout << "Hello World"; is used to print the message to 
screen. Finally, return 0; indicates that the program has ended successfully. This program is often used as the first step in learning C++ as it introduces basic structure and syntax.

Program 2:
This C++ program demonstrates the basic concept of arithmetic operations using user input. It allows the user to enter two numbers and then performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program 
uses variables to store the input and the results of each operation. Functions like cin and cout are used for taking input and displaying output. This helps beginners understand how to work with input/output, 
variables, and arithmetic operators in C++. It also introduces the structure of a simple C++ program.

Conclusion: Hence, we were able to print hello world and build a basic calculator in C++.
