## Theory

### Why C++ is More Efficient Than C

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Enables structured, modular, and reusable code.
- **Standard Template Library (STL):** Provides optimized data structures and algorithms.
- **Function Overloading & Default Arguments:** Offers flexibility and code efficiency.
- **Better Type Checking:** Ensures safer code and reduces runtime errors.
- **Dynamic Memory Management:** C++ provides `new` and `delete` for finer memory control.
- **Namespaces:** Prevent name collisions in large projects.

### Program 1: Hello World

This is the simplest and most traditional program used to introduce a new programming language. It helps beginners understand how a basic C++ program is structured and how to display output.

Purpose:
To display the message "Hello World" on the screen.

Key Concepts Introduced:
Header File Inclusion:

#include <iostream> includes the input/output stream library, necessary for using cout and cin.
Namespace Declaration:
using namespace std; enables direct use of standard library functions without prefixing them with std::.

Main Function:
int main() marks the entry point of the program. It is where the execution begins.

Output Statement:
cout << "Hello World"; prints a string message to the console.

Exit Statement:
return 0; indicates successful termination of the program.

Concepts Learned:
Basic syntax of a C++ program
Importance of main() function
Use of cout for output
Use of header files and namespaces

This program serves as the foundation for understanding how C++ handles program structure and output, paving the way for more complex applications.

### Program 2: Basic Calculator

This program takes two user inputs and performs:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

It demonstrates:
- Use of `cin` and `cout` for input/output
- Use of arithmetic operators
- Variable declaration and usage
- Simple program flow control

---

## Sample Output

```
Hello World
Enter first number: 80
Enter second number: 40
sum = 120
sub = 40
multiply = 3200
div = 2
```
## Conclusion

This experiment helped in:
- Understanding the basic structure of a C++ program.
- Performing arithmetic operations using variables and user input.
- Gaining hands-on practice with input/output operations and operators.
