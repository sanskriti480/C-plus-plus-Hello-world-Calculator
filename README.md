# Experiment 1: Hello World & Basic Calculator in C++

##  Aim
To understand the basic structure of a C++ program and implement a calculator using arithmetic operations.

---

## Tools used
Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

---

## Theory

### Program 1: Hello World

This program demonstrates the foundational structure of a C++ application.

- Includes the `<iostream>` header for input and output operations.
- `using namespace std;` simplifies access to standard library functions like `cout` and `cin`.
- The `main()` function is the starting point of execution.
- The line `cout << "Hello World";` prints a greeting message.
- `return 0;` signals the program's successful execution.

This program introduces:
- C++ syntax
- Output statement (`cout`)
- Program entry and exit structure

---

### Program 2: Basic Calculator

This program takes two user inputs and performs:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

It demonstrates:
- Use of `cin` and `cout` for input/output
- Use of arithmetic operators
- Variable declaration and usage
- Simple program flow control

### Why C++ is More Efficient Than C

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Enables structured, modular, and reusable code.
- **Standard Template Library (STL):** Provides optimized data structures and algorithms.
- **Function Overloading & Default Arguments:** Offers flexibility and code efficiency.
- **Better Type Checking:** Ensures safer code and reduces runtime errors.
- **Dynamic Memory Management:** C++ provides `new` and `delete` for finer memory control.
- **Namespaces:** Prevent name collisions in large projects.

## Sample Output
```
Hello World
Enter first number: 80
Enter second number: 40
sum = 120
sub = 40
multiply = 3200
div = 2
```
## Conclusion

This experiment helped in:
- Understanding the basic structure of a C++ program.
- Performing arithmetic operations using variables and user input.
- Gaining hands-on practice with input/output operations and operators.
